# Assuming there are 10 products waiting to be listed in a store:
# Six of them have a rarity of common, corresponding to a weight of 100;
# Three of them have a rarity of uncommon, corresponding to a weight of 80;
# One of them has a rarity of ancient, corresponding to a weight of 20.
# Then the total weight can be calculated as: 6 * 100 + 3 * 80 + 1 * 20 = 860.
# So, the probability of listing any common product in this store is: (6 * 100) / 860 * 100% = 69.7%
# In short, the higher the weight, the greater the probability of the product being listed.
